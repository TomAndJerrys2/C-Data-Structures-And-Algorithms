# Basic Implementations
Written in a mixture of C and C++ - I really wanted to learn how these work and learn the lowest
and most fundamental ideas. I tried to use a mixture of C/C++ so I could A) Use Classes and
other proficiencies to make it slighly easier and B) Use C type programming to ensure I understood
how dynamic allocation, reallocation and deletion worked in memory so my data structures could be more fluid.

# Implementations
- Basic Stack
- Basic Queue
- Basic LinkedList
- Basic Doubly-LinkedList
- Basic Circularly-LinkedList
